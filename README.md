# libintl

The C99 libintl header is used for internationalisation. This dub provides an easy way for importing it in Dlang projects.

libintl.h is part of Gnulib, and it is not a standard C header. It can be installed from [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).

An example for using this dub can be found in /example.
